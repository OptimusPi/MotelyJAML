/// three cutoff modes behave identically everywhere:
///
///   • Auto (running maximum): emit every seed at-or-above the best score seen so far. The bar
///     ratchets up as better seeds appear; ties at the current best are kept.
///   • Fixed floor: emit only seeds whose score is >= the floor.
///   • Off: emit everything.
///
/// This replaced two hand-kept-in-sync copies (CLI <c>ShouldEmitScore</c> and TUI
/// <c>PassesCutoff</c>) that could — and did — drift. It is thread-safe: result callbacks fire on
/// every engine worker thread with no serialization, so the auto ratchet uses a lock-free CAS loop
/// and the fixed/off paths are pure reads.
